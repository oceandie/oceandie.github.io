I am a physical oceanographer interested in understanding the mechanisms underpinning the multi-scales dynamics of the oceans.
My research involves using and contributing to develop numerical ocean models able to realistically represent the leading physical processes of the oceans. In particular, I am interested in improving our understaning and ability to simulate 

- Gravit currents in the ocean (e.g., overflows, cascades ...)

- The effect of topography on the oceanic flow (e.g. Gulf Stream and Slope current dynamics)

- Wind-waves and ocean currents interactions
 
Currently, I am a senior scientist of the [Ocean, Cryosphere and Dangerous Climate Change (OCDC)](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/our-scientists/cryosphere-oceans) division of the UK [Met Office Hadley Center](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/climate/met-office-hadley-centre/index). Within the OCDC group, I am part of the Ocean Modelling team, working on the development, design and assessment of global and regional [NEMO](https://www.nemo-ocean.eu/) based ocean models suitable for operational short-term and seasonal to decadal ocean forecasting and climate predictions.
