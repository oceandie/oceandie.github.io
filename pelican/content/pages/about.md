Title: About me
Date: 2019-05-27

I am a physical oceanographer and ocean modeller holding a MSc in Environmental Sciences (with majors in Numerical Modelling and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics) from the University of Bologna (Italy) and a PhD in Physical Oceanography and Ocean Modelling from the University of Plymouth (UK) - see my [CV]({attach}/pdfs/academic_cv.pdf) for more details.

I am interested in understanding the mechanisms underpinning the turbulent multi-scale dynamics of the oceans and how to improve their representation in numerical ocean models. In particular, my research interests include 

- The effect of topography on the oceanic flow (e.g. overflows, cascades, boundary currents ...)

- Accurate numerical schemes for generalised vertical coordinates (e.g., schemes for computing horizontal pressure forces)

- how to represent the interplay between the shelf seas and the deep ocean in large scale global models.
